URM14:
	- If disconnected, reading time > F acquisition -> infinite ReadSenors calls queue -> No logging anymore -> Buffers fill up.
	(PARTIALLY FIXED: Log LED gets updated by handleDigitalIO() interrupt)


GNSS:
	- 50% of module disconnections stop logging.
	(APPARENTLY FIXED)


LED:
	- Error blinks are not regular when handleDigitalIO() is called in loop.
	(FIXED: reste Metro timer after check())
	- If handleDigitalIO() as IntervalTimer, super quick blinks happen in stead of error blinks and after changing log button state (the longer the system wase longing, the longer the quick blinks remain).
	(FIXED: : reste Metro timer after check())

Logging:
	- Loosing one measurement at each log file segmentation.
